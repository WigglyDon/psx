# Architecture

## Product boundary

psx is a native PS1 player with a small user experience. Rust owns the app.
The borrowed core owns emulation, including guest CPU execution, emulated devices,
graphics and audio generation, disc interpretation and compatibility behavior.

Keep the upstream core intact behind its libretro C ABI. The native Rust host
supplies the callbacks and environment that the pinned core actually requires:
input state, file access, presentation, hardware graphics context, audio
consumption, persistence and host pacing. A single session owns the core.
FFI state must not outlive its session or cross thread/context boundaries
without the interface's required synchronization.

SwanStation is the pinned Android prototype candidate. Its suitability for
the eventual two-store product remains conditional on the checks in
[distribution.md](distribution.md). Keep player behavior in shared Rust and
platform handles inside small adapters. This boundary permits a deliberate
donor change if necessary; it does not call for a user-facing core selector.

## Android

Start with Rust Android/NDK bindings and NativeActivity as a candidate for
the first host. The runtime, controls, UI and save/file policies remain Rust.
Prove the document-picker result path explicitly; NativeActivity alone does
not establish that every Android callback can be implemented without a small
platform shim.

Prefer existing core rendering paths and direct native audio delivery. Avoid
unnecessary full-frame copies through managed UI and unbounded queues. Use
native PS1 resolution initially, normal emulated speed, automatic compatibility
defaults and one selected rendering backend. Treat low memory, low heat and
responsive input as measured goals, not consequences of a small interface.

Prove that the intended hardware-rendering path is active; a successful boot
through a software fallback is a different observation. Keep C-ABI callback
lifetimes, graphics-context reset/destruction and audio-thread ownership
explicit at the Rust boundary.

Surface destruction is not an instruction to erase a game session. Handle
pause, resume, focus, cancellation, orientation and folded/unfolded layouts.
Release held input on interruption. Preserve intentional user pause.

## iOS route

Use the same Rust session, input and save policies behind thin iOS bindings.
The eventual store build must operate without JIT or debugger attachment.
Prove the donor's non-JIT execution and an available iOS presentation path
on a physical device early, before promising iPhone support. Do not assume
Android Vulkan integration establishes a Metal or other iOS graphics path.
Keep this a bounded feasibility check alongside Android first playable,
not a second full product implementation.

## Files and saves

The ordinary action is to select one game. Android content URIs are access
handles, not ordinary filesystem paths. Use system document pickers and keep
their access grants valid. An iOS file selection has its own scoped access
and persistence rules. Disc sets can require companion files;
support the chosen input deliberately and explain any missing inputs plainly.
Do not read whole discs into memory by default.

Keep memory-card persistence separate from optional save-state resume.
Persist ordinary in-game saves safely and prove them after process restart.
Do not let an old save state silently roll back newer memory-card progress.

## Everyday use

The first screen offers Open game and, when available, a valid recent game.
The play screen offers comfortable controls and a clear pause action.
Choose core defaults in the app. Ask about firmware or missing companion
files only when the selected game needs them, using an actionable message.
Keep navigation accessible and usable across display sizes. Treat reliable
reopening, sound interruptions and saved progress as part of the experience.

## Delivery boundary

A working first playable means actual gameplay, sound, controls, durable
saving and interruption handling on the target device. A built library or
synthetic output is a technical checkpoint.

Keep this design small. Choose dependencies and implementations based on
the first playable result. Broad platform abstraction, new emulation work,
enhancement UI and performance-superiority claims require their own evidence.
